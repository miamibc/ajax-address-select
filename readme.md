Ajax address chain
==================

This is demo for Dm1tro. Hey dude, try to make something useful now :D

Interesting here
----------------

1. Use status code to detect what to do after we load data
2. Use shorthand load() method instead of $.post
4. No limits in chain length, all you need is to make array of elements

Todo
----

1. Try to access data using keys, not the values (change in ajax.php `<option value="key">value</option>`) and something in script.
2. Learn useful libs for interfaces, like [ExtJs](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) 
3. Separate model with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) or create interface with [Reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

Have phun :p
